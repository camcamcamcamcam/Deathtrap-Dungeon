					+ "town in the northern province of Chiang Mai. Situated on the banks of the "
					+ "River Kok it made a convenient stopover for river traders and passengers "
					+ "through-out most of the year. A few barges, rafts and sometimes even a "
					+ "large sailboat could usually be found moored at Fang. But all that was "
					+ "long ago, before the creation of the Trial of Champions. Now once a year "
					+ "the river is crammed with boats as people arrive from hundreds of miles "
					+ "around, hoping to witness the breaking of an ancient tradition in Fang "
					+ "and see a victor in the Trial of Champions.\n\n" + "On 1 May each year, warriors "
					+ "and heroes come to Fang to face the test of their lives. Survival is "
					+ "unlikely, yet many take the risk, for the prize is great - a purse of "
					+ "10,000 Gold Pieces and the freedom of Chiang Mai forever. However, to "
					+ "become Champion is no easy task. Some years ago, a powerful baron of Fang "
					+ "called Sukumvit decided to bring attention to his town by creating the "
					+ "ultimate contest. With the help of the townspeople, he constructed a "
					+ "labyrinth deep in the hillside behind Fang, from which there was only one "
					+ "exit. The labyrinth was filled with all kinds of deadly tricks and traps "
					+ "and loathsome monsters. Sukimvit had designed it in meticulous detail so "
					+ "that anybody hoping to face its challenge would have to use their wits as "
					+ "well as weaponskill. When he was finally satisfied that all was complete, "
					+ "he put his labyrinth to the test. He picked ten of his finest guards and, "
					+ "fully armed, they marched into the labyrinth. They were never seen again. "
					+ "The tale of the ill-fated guards soon spread throughout the land, and it "
					+ "was then that Sukumvit announced the finest Trial of Champions. "
					+ "Messengers and news-sheets carried his challenge - 10,000 Gold Pieces and "
					+ "the freedom of Chiang Mai forever to any person surviving the perils of "
					+ "the labyrinth of Fang. The first year, seven-teen brave warriors "
					+ "attempted ‘The Walk’, as it later came to be known. Not one reappeared. "
					+ "As the years passed and the Trial of Champions continued, it attracted "
					+ "more and more challengers and spectators. Fang prospered and would "
					+ "prepare itself months in advance for the spectacle it hosted each May. "
					+ "The town would be decorated, tents erected, dining-halls built, "
					+ "musicians, dancers, fire-eaters, illusionists and every sort of "
					+ "entertainer hired, and entries registered from hopeful individuals intent "
					+ "on making ‘The Walk’. The last week of April found the people of Fang and "
					+ "its visitors in wild celebration. Everybody sang, drank, danced and "
					+ "laughed until day broke on 1 May, when the town thronged to the gates of "
					+ "the labyrinth to watch the first challenger of the year step forward to "
					+ "face the Trial of Champions.\n\n" + "Having seen one of Sukumvit’s challenges "
					+ "nailed to a tree, you decide that this year you will attempt ‘The Walk’. "
					+ "For the last five years you have been attracted to, not for the rewards, "
					+ "but for the simple fact that nobody has ever yet emerged victorious from "
					+ "the labyrinth. You intend to make this the year in which a champion is "
					+ "crowned! Gathering up a few belongings, you set off immediately. Two "
					+ "days’ walk takes you west to the coast, where you enter the cursed Port "
					+ "Blacksand. Wasting no time in that city of thieves, you buy your passage "
					+ "on a small boat sailing north to where the River Kok meets the sea, and "
					+ "from there you take a raft up-river for four days, until finally you " + "arrive in Fang.\n\n"
					+ "The Trial begins in three days’ time, and the town is in "
					+ "an almost hysterical mood of excitement. You register your entry with the "
					+ "officials and are given a violet scarf to tie around your arm, informing "
					+ "everyone of your status. For three days you enjoy Fang’s greatest "
					+ "hospitality and are treated like a demigod. During the long merriment, "
					+ "you almost forget your purpose in Fang; but the evening before the Trial, "
					+ "the magnitude of the task ahead begins to dominate your thoughts. Later, "
					+ "you are taken to a special guest-house and shown to your room. There is a "
					+ "splendid four-poster bed with satin sheets to help you rest. But there is "
					+ "little time left for sleep.\n\n" + "Just before dawn a trumpet call awakens you "
					+ "form vivid dreams of flaming pits and giant black spiders. Minutes later, "
					+ "there is a knock on your door, and a man’s voice rings out saying, ‘Your "
					+ "challenge begins soon. Please be ready to leave in ten minutes.’ You "
					+ "climb out of bed, walk over to the window and open the shutters. Already "
					+ "people are thronging the streets, moving quietly through the morning mist "
					+ "- spectators on their way to the labyrinth no doubt, hoping to find good "
					+ "vantage points from which to watch the competitors. You turn away and "
					+ "walk over to a wooden table on which your trusty sword lies. You pick it "
					+ "up and cut the air with a mighty sweep, wondering what beasts its sharp "
					+ "edge may soon have to meet. Then you open the door into the corridor.\n\n"
					+ "A small man with slanted eyes greets you with a low bow as you emerge from "
					+ "your bedroom. ‘Please follow me,’ he says. He turns to his left and walks "
					+ "quickly toward the stairs at the end of the corridor. Leaving your "
					+ "guest-house, he darts down narrow alleyways between houses, and you have "
					+ "to walk quickly to keep up with him. Soon you come into a wide dirt road "
					+ "lined with cheering crowds. When they see your violet scarf, they cheer "
					+ "even louder and start showering you with flowers. The long shadows cast by "
					+ "the people in front of you shrink as the bright yellow sun rises higher "
					+ "in the morning sky. Standing here in front of the noisy and vibrant "
					+ "crowd, you feel strangely alone, aware of your coming ordeal. Suddenly "
					+ "you feel a tug on your shirt and see your small guide eagerly beckoning "
					+ "you to follow him. Ahead you see the looming hillside and the dark mouth "
					+ "of a tunnel disappearing into its inner depths. As you get closer, you "
					+ "notice two great stone pillars on either side of the tunnel entrance. The "
					+ "pillars are covered with ornate carvings: writhing serpents, demons, "
					+ "deities, each seeming to scream a silent warning to those who would pass beyond them.\n"
					+ "You see Baron Sukumvit himself standing by the entrance, "
					+ "waiting to greet the contenders in the Trial of Champions. You count five "
					+ "others standing proudly in line, their violet scarves displayed for all "
					+ "to see. There are two bare-chested Barbarians dressed in furs. They stand "
					+ "completely motionless, legs straight and slightly apart, arms thrust "
					+ "forward to rest on the hilts of their long, double-headed battleaxes. A "
					+ "sleek, elven woman with golden hair and feline green eyes is adjusting "
					+ "the cross-belt of daggers wrapped around her leather tunic. Of the two "
					+ "remaining men, one is covered from head to foot in iron-plate armour with "
					+ "a plumed helmet and a crested shield; the other is cloaked in black "
					+ "robes, only his dark eyes showing between the swathes of his black face- "
					+ "scarves. Long knives, a wire garrotte and other silent death-weapons hang "
					+ "from his belt. The five contenders acknowledge your arrival with almost "
					+ "imperceptible nods of the head, and you turn to face the exultant crowd "
					+ "for the last time. Suddenly a hush falls over the crowd as Baron Sukumvit "
					+ "steps forward holding six bamboo sticks. You draw one from his "
					+ "outstretched hand and read the word ‘Fifth’. Then the Trial begins.\n"
					+ "The Knight is first. He salutes the crowd before disappearing into the "
					+ "tunnel, and is followed half an hour later by the elf. Next goes a "
					+ "Barbarian and then the dark assassin. Now it is your turn to salute the "
					+ "crowd. Holding your violet scarf aloft, you take one final deep breath of "
					+ "cool fresh air before turning to pass between the stone-pillared gateway "
					+ "into Sukumvit’s corridors of power, to face unknown perils on ‘the Walk’ "
